# DIY - ARDUINO BASED CAR PARKING ASSISTANT

Introduction
----------------

Hi Friends,

I am back again with another Arduino based home automation project. This time I am trying to make my partner's life easy by installing a collision avoidance system in the garage to help her park the car safely without hitting the garage wall.

So, in this video, I am going to use an ultrasonic sensor to calculate the car's distance from the garage wall and display it using green, yellow and red LEDs. The color of LEDs indicates whether to keep moving, slow down, stop or go back.

The total cost of the project is around $20 - $25.
